Overview

The Titanic.ipynb Jupyter Notebook is a machine learning project designed to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the well-known Titanic dataset. It implements a complete workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction generation for a test dataset. This project is ideal for learning machine learning concepts or participating in competitions like Kaggle.

Objective

The goal is to build a binary classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster (0 for not survived, 1 for survived) based on features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, and more.

Dataset

The notebook uses two datasets:





train.csv: Training data with passenger details and the Survived target variable.



test.csv: Test data for generating predictions, without the Survived column.

Features





PassengerId: Unique passenger identifier.



Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3).



Name: Passenger's name.



Sex: Gender.



Age: Age (contains missing values).



SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.



Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.



Ticket: Ticket number.



Fare: Ticket fare.



Cabin: Cabin number (many missing values).



Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

A sample of the training data (train.sample(10)) reveals the dataset structure and missing values in Age and Cabin.

Dependencies

The notebook relies on the following Python libraries:





Data Manipulation: numpy, pandas



Visualization: matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn



Preprocessing: sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder)



Models: sklearn.ensemble (RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier), sklearn.linear_model (LogisticRegression), sklearn.neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier), sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeClassifier), sklearn.svm (SVC), sklearn.naive_bayes (GaussianNB)



Evaluation: sklearn.metrics (accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report)



Data Splitting: sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split)

Install dependencies using:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Workflow

The notebook follows a standard machine learning pipeline:





Data Exploration: Analyzes dataset structure, missing values, and feature distributions.



Data Preprocessing (inferred):





Handles missing values (e.g., imputing Age, dropping Cabin).



Encodes categorical variables (Sex, Embarked).



Scales numerical features (Age, Fare).



Potentially engineers features (e.g., family size or title extraction).



Model Training: Compares multiple models, with GradientBoostingClassifier selected as the best performer.



Prediction: Generates predictions on test.csv using the best model.



Output: Saves predictions to submission_jooo.csv with PassengerId and Survived columns, formatted for Kaggle submission.

Key Features





Model Selection: GradientBoostingClassifier is used as the final model, likely due to its robustness and performance.



Preprocessing: Addresses missing values and categorical features.



Evaluation: Uses multiple metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) for model assessment.



Output: Produces a submission-ready CSV file.

Usage





Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>



Prepare Datasets:





Place train.csv and test.csv in the /content/ directory or update the file paths in the notebook.



Datasets are available from Kaggle's Titanic competition.



Run the Notebook:





Open Titanic.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.



Ensure dependencies are installed.



Execute cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions.



Output:





The notebook generates submission_jooo.csv with predictions for the test set.

Potential Improvements





Feature Engineering: Add features like family size (SibSp + Parch) or extract titles from Name.



Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search for model optimization.



Cross-Validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation for robustness.



Imbalanced Data: Apply SMOTE or class weighting to handle class imbalance.



Visualization: Include plots for feature importance or confusion matrix.
